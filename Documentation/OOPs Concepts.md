# Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)

The aim of OOPs is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that 
no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

Object-oriented programming concepts are used to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc in programming.

## Object

An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object.
An Object contains both the data and the function, which operates on the data.

**Example:** A pen/pencil is an object because it has states like color, name etc. as well as behaviors like writing, sketching etc.

## Class

Collection of objects is called class.

**Example:** Assume if you had a class called “Expensive Cars” it could have objects like Mercedes, BMW, Toyota, etc. 
Its properties(data) can be price or speed of these cars. 
While the methods may be performed with these cars are driving, reverse, braking etc.

##	Inheritance
When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. 
It offers robust and natural mechanism for organizing and structure of any software.

**Example:** a child inherits the traits of his/her parents.

##	Polymorphism
Polymorphism refers to the ability of a variable, object or function to take on multiple forms.
In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

**Example:** to convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc.

## Abstraction
An abstraction is an act of representing essential features without including background details.
In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

**Example:** while driving a car, you do not have to be concerned with its internal working. 
Here you just need to concern about parts like steering wheel, Gears, accelerator, etc.

## Encapsulation
Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation.

**Example:** In school, a student cannot exist without a class.
